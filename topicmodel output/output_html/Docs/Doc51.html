LLOYD GEORGE APPEALS TO INDIA TO RESIST GERMAN PLAN
TO ESTABLISH TYRANNY OVER ASIA AS WELL AS EUROPE

LONDON, April 7.—In a (in eee to the Viceroy of India appealing to the
Government and the people to redouble their efforts to resist the intention, now
transparently clear, of the rulers of Germany to establish tyranny over Asia, as well

. as Europe, David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, says:

Thanks to the heroic efforts of the British Army, assisted by the Allies, the
enemy’s attempt in the west is being checked. But if we are to prevent the menace
spreading to the east and gradually engulfing the world, every lover of freedom

" and of law must play his part.

F After all it has dawned on the mind of the British Government that India can
successfully resist the German plan to dominate Asia. On our part we have never
doubted that a properly handled and properly led India could effectively save the situation
and keep Germany out of Asia. We hope she will.

The British Premier's Acknowledgments to India:—In the course of his speech
delivered in the House of Commons on April 9, in introducing a new bill for further
draft, the British Premier acknowledged India’s help in the war in the following terms:

“May I before I leave this topic, say how much gratitude we owe to India for the
magnificent way in which she has come to the aid of the Empire in this emergency.
